    "# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python\n",
    "As someone who studied a bit of C in the previous summer vacation, I can clearly see the difference between a low-level language and a high-level one. Python is really like elementary maths compared to C. **The level of language is based on how near or far the language is from machine language.** Typically, high-level languages are designed for human convenience, just like how Python has an exponential operator (double asterisks) while C does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two kinds of programs processes high-level languages to a low-level one:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;__Source Code >> Interpreter >> Output__<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;__Source Code >> Compiler >> Object Code >> Executor >> Output__\n",
    "     \n",
    "Personally, I prefer the second process because the machine doesn't need to read and transform the source code every time the code is used. Object code is much nearer to the machine code, making the execution faster.\n",
    "***\n",
    "Some terms that I need to familiarize with:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;__Program__ - Set of instructions<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;__Input__ - Get data from something<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;__Output__ - Display data <br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;__Math and Logic__ - Arithmetic and logical operators (&, !, etc.)<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;__Conditional execution__ - &&, ==, ||, and others<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;__Repetition__ - The infamous for and while loops, usually with if statements for variations\n",
